  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:
  # def default_url
  #   # For Rails 3.1+ asset pipeline compatibility:
  #   ActionController::Base.helpers.asset_path("fallback/" + [version_name, "default.png"].compact.join('_'))

  #   "/images/fallback/" + [version_name, "default.png"].compact.join('_')

  # process :scale => [200, 300]
  #
  # def scale(width, height)

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  version :thumb do
    process :resize_to_fit => [150, 150]
  end

  version :medium do
    process :resize_to_fit => [300, 300]

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:

  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
  # def filename
